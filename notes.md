# Introduction
Some things to do in the introduction:
- everyone get paper and pen
- write topic of talk
- write down any ideas they have for the talk
- write down any concerns they have **maybe handout papers and collect**
- what they want to get out of the workshop?
- mention it is a safe environment - NO BEING A TOOL
- we will likely be uncomfortable (because maybe being in front of a camera is uncomfortable....)
- mention strategy and tactics (they should have a good outline for the prezi at the end - is the goal)
- have people write down a single sentence of what they want the outcome of their video to be (if what they write down happens then their video is an unmitigated success!)

# Social Dev
 - make sure to do practices (move people around so they interact with people they don't know)
 - make sure to talk about how this is a little odd given that the camera is the *other person*

 # Technical Story
 - create outline here
 - in each are of the outline
 - maybe make things break on purpose for a little drama? 


# Mechanics
- make it real - it is ok if you don't say perfectly
- try to practice in front of a mirror
- try to do it in one take (exactly like if you were at a conference)
- make sure you thoroughly check your demo and run through it beforehand (this helps heaps with confidence)
- have your story in order (you can even have it on a piece of paper in front of you!!)
- you should feel excited about what you're going to talk about (if you're not you need to re-evaluate things)
